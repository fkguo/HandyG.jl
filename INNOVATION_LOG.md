# INNOVATION_LOG.md (Template)

Project: HandyG.jl
Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>

This file is an **idea portfolio** for maximizing scientific novelty while staying falsifiable.

Core rule: every idea must have
1) a clear claim/hypothesis,
2) a discriminant diagnostic or prediction (what would look different),
3) a minimal test (what to run/derive/measure),
4) a kill criterion (when we stop investing).

---

## 0. Portfolio Goals

- What “new insight” would count as success?
- What existing approaches/baselines must we beat or sharply distinguish from?

## 1. Portfolio Table (living)

| ID | Idea (1 sentence) | Discriminant (observable) | Minimal test | Falsified / kill criterion | Expected insight | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 |  |  |  |  |  | S/M/L | backlog |
| I2 |  |  |  |  |  | S/M/L | backlog |

Status options: backlog / prototyping / validated / ambiguous / killed.

## 2. Scoring (optional, to prioritize)

Use 1–5 scores (higher is better):
- Impact (broad significance)
- Differentiability (cannot be explained by obvious baseline)
- Falsifiability (clear pass/fail)
- Tractability (time-to-first-result)

| ID | Impact | Differentiability | Falsifiability | Tractability | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| I1 |  |  |  |  |  |

## 3. Innovation Sprints (per milestone)

At each milestone, reserve time for 1–2 quick prototypes (low-res is fine):
- Sprint goal:
- Candidate ideas (IDs):
- Deliverable (figure/table/derivation snippet):
- Decision: advance / revise / kill

## 4. Decisions Log (why we advanced/killed)

- <YYYY-MM-DD> I1: advanced — reason + next test
- <YYYY-MM-DD> I2: killed — reason + what we learned

## 5. “Innovation Delta” for the next team packet

Before each team cycle, fill:
- What is the **new falsifiable claim/diagnostic** added since last review?
- What baseline does it discriminate against, and how?
- What would falsify it?
