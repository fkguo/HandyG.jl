## Team Contract (Member A + Member B both do both)

You are acting as a research-team member doing an independent cross-check. Please:
1) Independently re-derive the key steps (from stated starting equations to final claim).
2) Independently reproduce (or at least re-check) the key computations from the provided artifacts.
3) List missing steps, unclear assumptions, sign/normalization ambiguities, circular definitions, or hidden fit parameters.
4) Provide a minimal fix list (what to add/change, and where).
5) Suggest 2–4 falsifiable “breakthrough leads” (discriminant + minimal test + kill criterion).
6) Check sweep semantics / parameter dependence (mandatory).
7) If applicable: check branch semantics / multi-root contract (mandatory).

Tool policy:
- Do NOT call external tools (including any network fetch, web search, shell commands, or running code) or claim to have executed code; use only the packet content.
- If you cannot verify an item without tools, mark it as a gap and FAIL that check.

Output format:

## Reproduction Summary
| Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Derivation replication | pass/fail | ... |
| Computation replication | pass/fail | ... |

## Verdict
- {ready for next milestone / needs revision}
- Blocking issues: [list or "none"]

## 0) Round & convergence gate

- Round/tag: (fill; e.g. M2-r1, M2-r2)
- Previous team reports: (fill paths)
- Adjudication/response note: (fill; required if you rejected/modified any member suggestion)
- Resolved items since last round: (fill; reference prior Minimal Fix List items)
- Open disagreements: (fill; must be classified as SCOPE/MATCHING and accepted by both members)
- Gate rule: if any mismatch/fail/needs revision, do not advance; apply fixes and re-run until convergence.

## 1) What changed since last round?

- Notes updated:
  - <paths>
- Code updated:
  - <paths>
- New data/artifacts:
  - <paths>
- New figures/tables:
  - <paths>

## 2) Definition-hardened quantities (exact operational definitions)

For each quantity: definition + code pointer + artifact pointer + uncertainty method.

- Q1:
- Q2:

## 2.5) Innovation delta (maximize novelty, keep falsifiable)

- New falsifiable claim/diagnostic since last round:
- What baseline does it discriminate against?
- What would falsify it / kill criterion?
- Idea portfolio updates (advance/revise/kill): <IDs from INNOVATION_LOG.md>

## 2.75) Sweep semantics / parameter dependence (must be answered)

- Scanned variables: (copy from capsule)
- Dependent recomputations: (copy from capsule; include formula/code pointers)
- Held-fixed constants: (copy from capsule; include scheme/scale)

## 2.85) Method selection (key choices or non-standard methods)

- Candidate methods/algorithms:
- Chosen approach and rationale:
- If skipped, rationale:

## 2.9) Audit slices / quick checks (required for complex computations)

- Key algorithm steps to cross-check (list functions/steps):
  - <step or function>:
- Proxy headline numbers (audit quantities; fast to verify by hand/estimate):
  - Q1: formula = ...; inputs = ...; expected = ...; artifact = <path>
  - Q2: formula = ...; inputs = ...; expected = ...; artifact = <path>
- Boundary or consistency checks (e.g., limits, symmetry, conservation):
  - <check>: expected = ...; artifact = <path>
- Trivial operations not rechecked (standard library, IO, plotting):
  - <item>: reason
- Audit slice artifacts (logs/tables):
  - <path>

## 3) Evidence bundle

- Figures (paths + 1-line description):
  - <fig>
- Tables/CSV:
  - <table>
- Provenance checks (commands + outputs):
  - <cmd>
- Reproducibility Capsule:
  - (must be present in the notebook; auto-extracted by build_team_packet.py)

## 3.1 Self-consistency checks (fill with numbers)

- Check A: headline formula re-evaluation:
  - Inputs:
  - Computed:
  - Reported:
  - Diff:
- Check B: definition identity check:
  - Inputs:
